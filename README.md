# steam-ETL

For our project we'll be looking at data regarding the video game platform Steam. We will segment and merge the given csvs into multiple tables and then bring everything back together in a clean, organized database using PostgreSQL and Pandas. Ideally, we'll drop the NaN values and perform some aggregations to add new categorical variables (such as a price breakdown).
